# Java Apereo CAS Client 
==================================

## Build
Please note that to be deployed in Maven Central, we mark a number of JARs as provided (related to JBoss and Memcache
Clients).  In order to build the clients, you must enable the commented out repositories in the appropriate pom.xml
files in the modules (cas-client-integration-jboss and cas-client-support-distributed-memcached) or follow the
instructions on how to install the file manually.
